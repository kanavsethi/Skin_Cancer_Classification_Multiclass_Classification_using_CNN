# Skin Cancer Detection - Multiclass Classification using CNN ü©∫üì∏

## Problem Statement üìú

Detecting skin cancer, particularly melanoma, is a critical task in the medical field. Melanoma accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that can accurately detect skin cancer from images, helping dermatologists identify potential cases more efficiently and reducing the need for manual diagnosis.

## Approach üõ†Ô∏è

We use TensorFlow to build the CNN model and leverage data augmentation techniques to address overfitting. Augmentation helps create variations of the training images, making the model more robust and capable of generalizing to unseen data. We use Tensorflow Augmentation as well as the Augmentor Python package is used for image augmentation.

## Model Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The CNN model has the following structure:
